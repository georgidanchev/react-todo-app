# react_todo_app

This the first project I've done using React and JSX. This project is a straight copy from following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A) tutorial by Brad from Traversy Media. The project utilizes the react starter framework, not my own framework. There are few cons to this project, even though this project is completed and tested against the original code from the tutorial, the build mode doesn't work - you get a blank page. As a first project, I have no clue what is causing this and I will leave it as it is. Moving forward I will try to learn more and figure out how to deal with these sorts of issues.
